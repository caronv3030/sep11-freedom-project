### Content

What I been facing with my tools and what kind of game I want to create and making the game with. First I thought I was going to stick with my tool phaser or kaboom. I was facing with a slight problem since I wasn't sure what I was going to be able to do. I both find very useful and very equally challenged for me to understand. Then I was then going to work in a group with Kiara first but then Kiara brought other person into the project aka (Robert)! Then we discussed what type of project that we like to do.

### Engineering Design Process

We first dicussed how we are going to do it on a app called Discord. We were all in a groupchat today for step 1. Step 2, we discussed what we like to do on the project and Robert decided that we should do something that is related with plants soooo then we made it into a garderning game. Next we also discussed about what we would also like it to have into a actual game like a catching the leaves game or kind of a cooking mama game since me and Kiara love cooking mama as a kid which we also took some inspiration from the game to add it into our game. Then we all talked about what type of tool we would like to use and we all have important tools for the project and how they can be used very useful and differently at the same time. Which then for my Step 3, I would still be researching and trying to use more examples to help me understand how to use my tool better and how I can also work on backgrounds,food, the items that will be needed in the project.

### Skills

The skills that I learned from this blog is *Communicating, Trying things even if you aren't sure what you would want to do.* Communication is important because if you don't communicate then how can you understand what your part is in the project and evem what type of project you guys would like to work on together.

Trying things even if you aren't sure what you would want to do. I say this because if I didn't tinker Kaboom, then I wasn't sure how I was going to really be able use phaser. And it never hurts to try something even if you don't think about it, it should still happen.

### Summary

I an overall very exicted to countine with my game with my garderning game and working my tool. And hoping in the future that in the future i can use to make a game about a gardening game for peole like Robert and people who also like games similar to cooking mama.
