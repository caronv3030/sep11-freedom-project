### Context/ Review

I'm using my tool to help me use it for my freedom project that I'm working with my classmate/friend, Kiara and Robert.  We are all using different tools to put it all in one game! Robert is using phaser, Kiara is using p5play and I'll be using [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com) as my tool. What I learned that I used for my code was how to use as the example and I went to look over what I have done and what things are taken to be made and fixed. After trying to still play around with my tool, I have to plan out what I need to do to include my tool into the freedom project.
