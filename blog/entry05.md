### Context
I'm using my tool to help me use it in my freedom project of a garden game with my teamates, Kiara and Robert. We all have different tools but we are going to mange to combine al out tools together and make a amazing game. My tool is [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup) and my parther's tools are very cool and unique. We have a plan on how we would want the game to work but it's not the best right now since we are slowly working on it and slowly building the game slowly and slowly. However, over time we talked about the inputted in the game and the ones that we didn't want. Which had made the work easier for us to work on into building our ***Freedom Project*** with great confidence.

During spring break, my group had worked on the MVP but I was very busy during the break but we talked it out that the main menu would be for the beyond MVP and that I would be working on would be for the future work. Which had given me a lot of time to work on the code for the main menu by myself. Or so I thought... but I was struggling a lot and I went to ask my friend, Chris for help of the main menu and he explained and teached me how the code would work.

My group also had created a sample game of how the game playout would be. Kiara and Robert had worked on the game with the details. The yellow is the enemy and the green is what you are suppose to collect to get a lot thats dropping to get a huge high score.

### My sample code of the Main Menu

```JS

scene("start", () => {
    play("MenuTheme")

    add([
        text("Eat All"),
        pos(center()),
        scale(2),
        anchor("center"),
    ])

    add([
        sprite("Menu"),
        pos(center()),
        scale(2),
        anchor("center"),
    ])

    onKeyPress(() => go("game"))

})

```

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
---
I would say that we are still on the second stage, but slowly moving towards the third once we are able to discuss on how we are going to be able to combine our tools together since it seems that it may be a hard struggle for us but nothing in life will come easy. I will still be tinkering with [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com) while using replit for now. But hopefully by next time, I'll be able to be on the third stage of the process slowly building the process of a great gardening game. But now I'm taking bigger steps like the levels in the game.

### Skills

### Distractions 

I can get distracted by little things which made me lose my focus on what I would need to get done really quickly which is pretty annoying but I would still be mangeable to get my work done when I don't look on my phone or anything else but just working and working with my headphones in with some classic jazz music.

## Takeaways

We had communicated and as we should, and now after communicating, I feel like now I can take bigger steps into the project to making it slowly better and better. In the future, hopefully I would be half-way done with my level if I can and being able to combine all our work together.
