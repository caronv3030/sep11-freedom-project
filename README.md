# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Caron Voon**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Kaboom** in order to help me make **A Gardening Game**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* The game was very fun to play and makes me enjoy the game by a lot.
* I understood a lot on how to make 2 tools linked together.
* The creativity of the game of our intrustions and the game combined together.
##### CONS
* There were small errors that I would barely notice unless I look very close into it.
* Communication was slacking a lot but were making it work at the same time.
