# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: Kaboom

## Project: Gardern Project

---

### 09/24/24:

* I was thinking about using phaser or kaboom then just decided to keep it as phaser since I thought it would be easier than the rest.
  
* Settled to work with Kiara and Robert, talked and dicuss about what we can do for the project


### 9/30/24:

* We had confirmed what we wanted to use and what type of game we would want to create.

* Robert wanted to do something that had garden with plants in it, so we made it into a gardening game like catching the leaves or picking the fruuits from the garden.

* We each had a different tool to use for the game since we seemed to have a different opinion from what tool we would like to use.

### 10/10/24

* Started to learn about functions which seems to be a easier unit than what I was understanding from the first 2 and then about how it could really be used in the game for my freedom project so I would most likely to do that.

* Then after thinking about what I really wanted to commit to use between, phaser or kaboom, I still stayed with phaser since I still wasn't able to understand how to tinker kaboom on my own.

### 10/21/24

* After thinking a while about between really choosing phaser and kaboom, I decided to change into Kaboom.

* All though, Kaboom is very popular, it was easier for me to actually try with a help of my friend. Kaboom seems very easy and much more easier to use than phaser. And I also had to search up how to use kaboom and using the example from a video to show me what it is used and how it can be used.

#### Experincing with Kaboom and watching videos about Kaboom and Learning with other people

* First I would be watching videos about the Javascript while using kaboom on replit since that was what the youtube video that I was watching on that was working on.
  
  * I was watching a youtube video that was showing many ways about how to use kaboom to turn it into a game. which it also has 15 videos that was in a playlist [Kaboom Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRXI6ThRJvM&list=PLNwtXgWIx3rgk68WwrykC7BIJ50kT6ZpS). This video has strongly helped me with understanding what type of games that can used while using kaboom.
    
  * Which after the video, I worked on using replit and then I would be basically copying word for from the video to see what type of things that I would be to make and not messing up my code at all. Making small changes like the background and even seeing if it is able for me to change the characters in the game.


### 1/6/25

### Beginning of the Plan

  ### Kiara: the charcter movements/uses 5play
  ### Robert: the games background/ making the plants 
  ### Caron: Making the game seem more interesting and possibily make a small little game in the game at the same time.

#### Kiara 
 
She is working on the charcter which she has accomplished and can be able to make the charcter move around using 5play. Her tool is used to make the gardener move with using the move but she wasn't able used the keys for the character manually. 

#### Robert and Caron

He is working on his tool but I was still trying to involve myself into the project but since we dont have a part to do what we are suppose to use to basicallt involve us into the game. But Robert is mostly going to add like little plants because the theme is gardening and for me, I'll see what I can do to be able to see what parts are needed to all work together in the project.
