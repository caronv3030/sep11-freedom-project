# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: Kaboom

## Project: Gardern Project

---

### 09/24/24:

* I was thinking about using phaser or kaboom then just decided to keep it as phaser since I thought it would be easier than the rest.
  
* Settled to work with Kiara and Robert, talked and dicuss about what we can do for the project


### 9/30/24:

* We had confirmed what we wanted to use and what type of game we would want to create.

* Robert wanted to do something that had garden with plants in it, so we made it into a gardening game like catching the leaves or picking the fruuits from the garden.

* We each had a different tool to use for the game since we seemed to have a different opinion from what tool we would like to use.

### 10/10/24

* Started to learn about functions which seems to be a easier unit than what I was understanding from the first 2 and then about how it could really be used in the game for my freedom project so I would most likely to do that.

* Then after thinking about what I really wanted to commit to use between, phaser or kaboom, I still stayed with phaser since I still wasn't able to understand how to tinker kaboom on my own.

### 10/21/24

* After thinking a while about between really choosing phaser and kaboom, I decided to change into Kaboom.

* All though, Kaboom is very popular, it was easier for me to actually try with a help of my friend. Kaboom seems very easy and much more easier to use than phaser. And I also had to search up how to use kaboom and using the example from a video to show me what it is used and how it can be used.
